Dead celebrity checker - Checks whether celebrities have died

Create a list of celebrities in the text file celebs.txt (the default is a list of 274 celebrities).

The name of each celebrity must lead to their article on Wikipedia. For example, "Seal" doesn't work because it leads to a disambiguation page, but "Will Arnett" leads directly to his page so will work.

This checks Wikipedia periodically to see if any of the celebrities in the list have died. If it finds that one has died, it will show a notification saying which celebrity has died.
